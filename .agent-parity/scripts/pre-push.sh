# It refuses a push while any of agent-parity's managed artifacts are
# uncommitted, so a new memory or a wiring change is never left behind on the
# machines that pull this repo. git's own ignore rules decide what counts:
# generated copies (.claude/skills, the binary cache) are ignored, so only files
# meant to be committed ever surface here.
